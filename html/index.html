                    The "<span class="channel">Going Seventeen: EGO</span>" pack is a thriller themed, 2-episodes-deal, Halloween Special.
                    Though horror is the most prominent vibe you may get when you jump into the video, there is definitely a sense 
                    of mystery in the series as you watch it closely. Many fans of the series, called Carats (fanbase of the Kpop group,
                    Seventeen, themselves) and Cubics (fanbase of the <span class="channel">Going Seventeen</span> web series itself), freely come up with their own 
                    theories and expectations in between the two separate release dates of each episode. This gives creative freedom
                    in the minds and in the imaginations of the viewers. 
                    It may even stimulate you as some parts may get you thinking of what may come next,
                    or even get your heart racing.

                    Hello, my name is Jade G., and I am the author of this fansite. 
                    I made this website into an episode-specific topic because I wanted to show 
                    the uniqueness and production of the web series, <span class="channel">Going Seventeen</span> .
                    Even if it's an extended project of the group, they provide high quality topics and entertainment 
                    that rouses many viewers, not only as a k-pop fan, but also others 
                    who simply want to watch something enjoyable.
                </p>

                <p class="highlight">
                    Please feel free to watch and enjoy the show amongst yourselves as well. 
                    Though it may be confusing or unfamiliar to some of you, you are free to watch it at your own interest and time. 
                    Granted that I may not have introduced the most appealing episode(s) to some, be rest assured 
                    that there are more contents in which they film and release that may better suit your taste.
                </p>
                                
                <p>
                    If you are already a fan of the series (Cubics), or even SEVENTEEN themselves (Carats), I thank you for visiting
                    this little website. I know how much you love to support the group as a whole, and also how much
                    you love <span class="channel">Going Seventeen</span>. Please continue to watch more upcoming episodes with me, and let us
                    enjoy them to the fullest. Thank you.
