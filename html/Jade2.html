                    For me, Going Seventeen's EGO is one of the most unique concepts they featured on their channel. Back in 2020, they released
                    a horror special called "The Tag" where they visited a "haunted house" escape room. In 2021, EGO was released
                    with a complete, film-accented storyline. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    EGO is filled with suspenseful, humorous, and mysterious scenes that I particularly liked. 
                    In this page, I will be highlighting some of my personal favorite scenes.

                    to go inside the locker for some unknown reason. Things took a turn when he stepped out 
                    and made eye contact with the doctor standing by the door.

                    Jeonghan and DK, who were both immensely doubtful of freeing the hostage calling out for help,
                    started asking the man himself what to do because they were too confused to do anything else.
                    Finally, DK freed the man from his seat.

                    a locker, which was a death flag in the clue they got, so that whatever was inside would take
                    the hostage instead of them.

                    This was the moment when chills ran down my spine. The two were figuring out which key could
                    be used at the exit door, but the sudden screech of their previous friend jumped them to freeze. 
                    They stared at him in confusion for a while, but let out a disappointed sigh. 
                    To make things worse, the "hostage" even gracefully opened the door for the doctor to come in and to take them.

            <h3>Discussions and Theories from Reddit</h3>
            <p>
                Under <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/seventeen/comments/qh9wtl/can_someone_explain_the_storyline_of_ego/">r/seventeen on Reddit</a>, 
                user "<span class="user">u/ExactHabit</span>" posted their very own theory:
            </p>

            <p class="reddit">
                "  Okay, I'm just going to lay out my understanding of it. (there are a few other interpretations out there, 
                which I think are equally valid, but I'm just going to give what I think)
                Dr. Arthur Kim is a head doctor performing human cloning experiments, 
                and all the clones are of different researchers/doctors in the lab.
                We are watching a particular experiment to test the phenomena of clones being able to get merged memories 
                from previous clones (though initially started to figure out how they were getting better at escape attempts). 
                The design of the experiment was set up to make the clones think they could escape and then observe their behavior in a controlled environment. 
                That is the reason why the doctors, for the most part, don't really change their hiding spaces and patterns of behavior. 
                It's all a study designed to test whether the clones remember their previous deaths and other clues, so in reality there was never any way to escape. 
                They encounter various scenarios to test their memory, like whether or not they choose to help Siyu (who, if you notice, 
                purposely keeps the same dialogue/scenario where he doesn't remember or know anything -- that's because he's an actor/doctor to test their memory). 
                Every time the clones die in their attempt to "escape", they create new ones (from other doctors) using merged memories and data from the previous rounds of this study.
                Mingyu's self awareness was an unintended result of the study, 
                and they killed him to collect his body + data to use in future experiments 
                (with hopefully resulting in self-aware clones).  "
            </p>

            <p>
               Another user from the same Reddit thread called "<span class="user">u/Carmtal_Black</span>" posted:
            </p>

            <p class="reddit">
                "  I just figured it out. It took me a while but I understand now. I was overthinking it.
                Dr. Kim Arthur (Mingyu) and his lab crew (the rest of Svt) were involved in unethical clone experiments. 
                But they weren't cloning random people, they were cloning themselves. 
                So they set up an experiment for the clones. Arther & Co wanted to see if they could transfer memories from clone to clone (the polaroids). 
                The clones looked different, modeled after their creators, but they had the same brain transferred over and over again. 
                Every time a clone failed, they were considered a failure and killed by their creators aka the doctors aka Svt. 
                This was considered unethical not because they were testing on innocent humans because they were testing on themselves. 
                It was unethical because their clones were real enough to be considered real people but when the doctors didn't need them anymore they were simply killed. 
                The clone of Arthur himself (Mingyu), happened to figure out the experiment by remember his past attempts. Mingyu clone was a success. 
                The doctors now know without a doubt that the clones have residual memories but now that they have their results they no longer needed him. 
                So Arthur killed his clone Now Arthur & Co are off to conduct the next experiment using their clones.  "
